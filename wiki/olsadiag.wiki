A simple diagnostics page is included that allows an administrator to confirm if the OLSA settings work

The page /mod/skillsoft/olsadiag.php

Will perform the following simple tests:

  # Checking SOAP Extension is loaded
  # Checking cURL Extension is loaded
  # Checking OLSA Settings are configured
  # Is OLSA EndPoint Accessible
  # Check Time Synchronisation
  # Create OLSA SOAP Client
  # Check OLSA Authentication
