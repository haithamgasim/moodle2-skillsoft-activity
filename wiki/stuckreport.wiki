=Introduction=
When using Track To OLSA (Custom Report) mode sometimes the cycle will become stuck.

You can clear a stuck cycle by setting the "Reset the custom report cycle" setting in the configuration.

This will clear the previous "stuck" report and restart the cycle at the beginning by requesting a new report when teh CRON job next runs.
